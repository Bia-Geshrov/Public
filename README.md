This Directory contains tools used to Connect to youtube's server through the command line interface without the use of an 'API', Granting access to view all a channel's information with the use of a URL, i.e. <br> ```bash yts -di https://www.youtube.com/@%D0%91%D1%8C%D1%8F_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%88%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2``` <br> will be able to fetch all the contents of the channel "Бья_Гешров," along with the chanels it has linked in its 'About Me', and their contents. This tool can be useful for Identifying Bot Accounts without the need for using a browser or even clicking the links the channel has, since the script 'yts' unshortens the shortened URL, as well as providing the user with all the raw images it has on the webpage (raw images like src='image.png'), without the need to analyse too much of the page themselves.
